This project was conducted at the HackPVTA, a Hackathon hosted by the University of Massachusetts Graduate Researchers interested in Data
club (UMass Amherst GRiD). We were interested in exploring what factors can account for deviation in the PVTA bus schedule 
(consequentially causing the bus to be late). We created weekday/weekend status, rush hours and holiday status predictors to assess if day
of week, time of day and whether or not a month has holidays could account for the deviation in the bus schedule. For this project,
we used tidyr and dplyr for data wrangling/data cleaning. This analysis was performed over four different months (February, October, March,
November) with Bus 38 route (most widely used by the Five College Consortium students). March and November were categorized as holiday
months due to spring break and Thanksgiving holiday, respectively. We observed that deviation from the bus schedule is higher on weekends
than weekdays for February, October and November. In comparison, deviation is higher on weekdays than weekends in March. We also observed
that deviation from bus schedule is lower in afternoon in October and morning rush hours than afternoon and evening non rush hours on weekends and weekdays. In comparison, deviation from bus schedule is mostly constant on weekend in February for
the different rush hours while deviation is high for afternoon rush and afternoon non rush hours on weekdays. In comparison, deviation is higher for evening non rush hours in March and higher for afternoon rush hours in November
on weekday (See attached FinalPresentation for further overview as well Code for overview of statistical techniques used).
